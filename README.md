# 2048 Game 
2048 is a popular single-player game for Web and mobile. It's a type of “sliding block puzzle” — think Threes!, on which 2048 is based, or the old-timey game klotski — that's played on an almost Sudoku-like grid. The object of the game is to combine the numbers displayed on the tiles until you reach 2048
